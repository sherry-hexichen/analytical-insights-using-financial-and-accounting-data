Financial and accounting data is different from other types of data due to its extremely large volume and its complexity.

Three coding exercises are documented here to show the data analysis using financial and accounting data from *Wharton Research Data Service (wrds)* (https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/).

**Coding Exercise 1** - Detect earnings management from data.
**Coding Exercise 2** - Understand and replicate *Accrual Anomaly*.
